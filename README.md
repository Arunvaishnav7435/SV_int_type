# SV_int_type
Problem Statement: to find maximum value of unsigned int, unsigned shortint and unsigned longint in Systemverilog.
When we decrement 1 from a unsigned variable which holds 0 value it will wrap back to maximum value. I used that to find maximum value.
long unsigned int size: 128 bit
unsigned int size: 64 bit
short unsigned int size: 32 bit
